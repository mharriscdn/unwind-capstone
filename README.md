# unwind-capstone

UNWIND is a deterministic, constraint-based conversational system designed to prevent narrative drift by redirecting users from story-level engagement to direct sensation-level contact.

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation artifacts for the MSSE Capstone Project.

## Primary Documentation (Capstone)

The full capstone documentation lives in /docs:

- docs/UNWIND_Capstone_README.pdf  
  Core concept, system rationale, and architectural overview.

- docs/UNWIND_Design_Testing.pdf  
  Scenario-based evaluation framework and testing methodology.

These PDFs are the authoritative explanation of the project.

## Repository Structure

- /code — Application code, scenarios, and tests  
- /docs — Capstone documentation (PDF)

## Quick Run (Optional)

pip install -r code/requirements.txt  
python code/app_cli.py  
python code/scenarios/run_all.py

## Notes

This project is intentionally constraint-driven and non-adaptive by design.  
It is not a general-purpose chatbot or therapeutic system.
